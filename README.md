- 👋 Hi, I’m @1MegaMan1
- 👀 I’m interested in robotics. I am a bit focused in my interests and specifically interested in the software aspect of robotic control. I completed my thesis
- in Adaptive Human-Robot Motion Transfer for Complete Body Imitation. The reasoning is because imitation is a great stepping stone to goal of fully autonomous
- robots. I continue to have an interest since in robotics since I was a kid. Megaman was my inspiration and still continues to this day.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about linear algebra. Anyone can learn the formulas but my goal is to be familiar enough to look at the linear algebra
-  like a written language and read what is transpiring. Most of my thesis was learning the kinematics. The infamous questions, Where am I? Where is the goal?
-  How to get to the goal?

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on other robotic projects.
